# Solar-System
This code displays a sun, earth, and moon in a basic solar system simulation.
This is a simple Solar System simulation created using HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I can customize the Solar System by adding more planets, asteroids, and other celestial objects. 
You can also interact with the Solar System by zooming in and out 
and clicking on a planet to get more information.
